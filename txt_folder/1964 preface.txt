PREFACE
Durable satire is perhaps the rarest of literary phenomena. Yesterday's burning issues have a way of becoming todayâ€™s ashes. The best satires in English have had in them strong strains of adventure and action--the first half of Butler's Erewhon is still very readable, but the allegorical second half drags--to recommend them to later ages. Mao Ch'eng Chi has always been deficient in this respect; Lao Sheh devoted no more than a paragraph to the arrival of his eye-witness on the planet Mars for example. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of poignancy in the book, for it was written by an author who, though he had not reached the height of his creative powers, was at least a free agent and frank critic of his country and the forces which held it in captivity. Those who read it today with an eye to the past it satirizes will be reminded of many things which are too easily forgotten; those who read it as an almost forgotten creation from the hand of one of modern China's finest literary craftsmen will be moved, I believe, by the great change which has taken place. The free agent, the frank critic is no more and some of the distempers of China which he satirized are gone--all have been drowned in a sea of "dee-doong-dee-doong hualovsky"
